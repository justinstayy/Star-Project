# Star-Project
Econometrics project using the Project STAR dataset to analyze the impact of class size and teacher characteristics on student achievement.

This university project applies econometric methods to the Project STAR dataset from Stock & Watsonâ€™s Introduction to Econometrics. The analysis investigates the causal effects of classroom type (small class, regular class, or regular with aide) and teacher experience on student test scores in grades K through 3. We use OLS regression models with appropriate controls to test hypotheses about educational outcomes.
