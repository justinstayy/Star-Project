            "1. These tables demonstrate the relationship between two critical parameters:\n",

            "   b. Class Size: Columns represent the number of students per class.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The values in the table are the calculated benefit-to-cost ratios.\n",
            "3. Interpretation:\n",
            "   a. Higher teacher costs or smaller class sizes decrease the benefit-to-cost ratio.\n",
            "   b. Lower teacher costs and larger class sizes improve the benefit-to-cost ratio.\n",

            "Recommendation for Proposed Class-Size Reduction Scenarios:\n",
            "\n",
            "Recommendation:\n",
            "1. Scenario K (Kindergarten only) is more cost-effective and feasible when teacher costs are moderate and class sizes are larger (e.g., 20–25 students).\n",
            "   This scenario shows a higher benefit-to-cost ratio, making it a better option if budget constraints are significant.\n",
            "2. Scenario K-3 (Kindergarten through 3rd grade) provides higher overall benefits due to sustained smaller class sizes but is significantly more expensive.\n",
            "   This scenario should only be considered if long-term funding is secured and improving early childhood education outcomes is a top priority.\n",
            "\n",
            "Data-Driven Justification:\n",
            "- Scenario K achieves a reasonable benefit-to-cost ratio, especially with optimized teacher costs and manageable class sizes.\n",
            "- Scenario K-3 requires higher initial investments but shows substantial long-term benefits, especially in improving lifetime earnings for students.\n",
            "\n",
            "Key Limitations:\n",
            "1. Cost Sensitivity: The benefit-to-cost ratio is highly sensitive to teacher salaries and class sizes, which vary across regions and schools.\n",
            "2. Assumptions: The analysis assumes a linear relationship between reduced class size and student outcomes, which may not hold universally.\n",
            "3. Discounting: The discount factor (3%) impacts the present value of benefits and costs, and changes to this rate could significantly alter conclusions.\n",

        "Recommendation:\n",
        "1. Scenario K (Kindergarten only) is more cost-effective and feasible when teacher costs are moderate and class sizes are larger (e.g., 20–25 students).\n",
        "   This scenario shows a higher benefit-to-cost ratio, making it a better option if budget constraints are significant.\n",
        "2. Scenario K-3 (Kindergarten through 3rd grade) provides higher overall benefits due to sustained smaller class sizes but is significantly more expensive.\n",
        "   This scenario should only be considered if long-term funding is secured and improving early childhood education outcomes is a top priority.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data-Driven Justification:\n",
        "- Scenario K achieves a reasonable benefit-to-cost ratio, especially with optimized teacher costs and manageable class sizes.\n",
        "- Scenario K-3 requires higher initial investments but shows substantial long-term benefits, especially in improving lifetime earnings for students.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Limitations:\n",
        "1. Cost Sensitivity: The benefit-to-cost ratio is highly sensitive to teacher salaries and class sizes, which vary across regions and schools.\n",
        "2. Assumptions: The analysis assumes a linear relationship between reduced class size and student outcomes, which may not hold universally.\n",
        "3. Discounting: The discount factor (3%) impacts the present value of benefits and costs, and changes to this rate could significantly alter conclusions.\n",
        "4. Extrapolation of Benefits: Assumes benefits measured in early trials (like Project STAR) apply across broader contexts and over time.\n",
        "5. Limited Scope: The analysis focuses on financial metrics and does not account for broader social benefits, such as improved community outcomes or reduced inequality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Final Recommendation:\n",
        "Implement Scenario K as a pilot program to validate the assumptions and monitor its effectiveness under local conditions.\n",
        "Scale to Scenario K-3 only if sufficient funding and strong evidence from the pilot demonstrate sustainable benefits.\n",
